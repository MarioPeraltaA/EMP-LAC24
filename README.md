## Energy Modelling Platform 2024

> The main objective of EMP-LAC 2024 is to contribute to creating optimized investment business cases for energy transition in the region. Attracting this investment will meet the continent's growing demand for low-carbon, inclusive and climate-resilient development pathways, while leveraging its own large resource base. This is an excellent opportunity to participate in discussion forums with peers, and receive training on models and tools for energy planning needs.
